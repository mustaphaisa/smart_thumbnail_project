ReadMe For Smart-Thumbnails MATLAB Program
===============================================

Unzip the file smart_thumbnail.zip
The folder should contain all supporting code and images. The main MATLAB function
that takes in the name of the digital image to be processed is called thumbnail. 
It has one parameter which is the name of the image to be processed. Users are 
prompted for the name of images when the program is run. For simple testing, use 
the images in our package or else import others into directory.

The algorithm then passes the image matrix through each of the follwing priorities:
getSizeMatrix(image) 
getColorMatrix(image) 
getLocationMatrix(image) 
getDistinctMatrix(image, no of passes) 
getBrightnessMatrix(image, weight) 
faceDetectionMatrix(image, weight) 
bodyDetectionMatrix(image, weight)
